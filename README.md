## Authors: Robert Dunski, Scott "Sean" Lowe, and Daniel Seagraves (currently MIA)
### Final Project for Video Game Design

Originally intended to be a comedic 2D sidescrolling adventure-RPG, 
advanced features of the game were never finished in time, but basic movement, 
health system, sound functionality, and basic framework are all in place.

+ Written in C++, using the SDL2 open-source library
+ Developed originally in Visual Studio (~~looking to get rid of all the noise it creates in the file system~~)
+ Looking to reduce Repo size by condensing or eliminating the extra files from SDL2
